 **<h3 align="left">My name is Vladislav, and I am an aspiring Java developer with a strong desire to grow professionally in IT. I have a solid theoretical foundation and practical experience gained from studies and training projects.

I have worked with essential Java tools and technologies, including JDBC, Maven, Git, Docker, and the Spring Framework. My experience also extends to SQL and NoSQL databases.

I enjoy tackling new challenges that help me grow as a professional. I thrive in team environments, actively participating in discussions, sharing knowledge, and learning from others.

I am looking for an opportunity to join a company where I can apply and enhance my skills.</h3>
